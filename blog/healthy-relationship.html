    <h1>Building a Healthy Christian Relationship</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Relationships are a gift from God. Whether friendships, dating, or marriage, He designed them to help us grow, love, serve, and reflect His character. Yet many people enter relationships looking for completion, validation, or personal fulfillment first. A healthy Christian relationship is different—it starts with Christ at the center and flows into love, trust, and purpose.</p>

    <h2>1. Christ Must Be the Foundation</h2>
    <p>A relationship cannot be stronger than the source it’s built on. When the foundation is emotions, attraction, or personal desires, it becomes unstable. The Bible reminds us:</p>
    <p>“Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.” —Psalm 127:1 (KJV)</p>
    <p>Placing Christ first means praying together, studying God’s Word, seeking godly counsel, and making decisions that honor Him. When both people pursue Christ individually, they grow stronger together.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Love Should Reflect God’s Character</h2>
    <p>The world defines love as a feeling, but God defines love as a commitment rooted in sacrifice and truth. The most complete description of love is found in 1 Corinthians 13:</p>
    <p>“Charity suffereth long, and is kind…” (1 Cor. 13:4–7 KJV)</p>
    <p>In a healthy Christian relationship, love is patient during disagreements, kind in speech, humble in correction, and forgiving in conflict. Love is more than romance—it's a demonstration of Christ’s heart toward one another.</p>

    <h2>3. Healthy Boundaries Protect Purity</h2>
    <p>God created physical attraction—it is a blessing when kept in its proper place. Purity protects intimacy, prevents guilt, and keeps our hearts aligned with God’s will. Respecting boundaries is an act of worship, not restriction.</p>
    <p>“For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.” —1 Thessalonians 4:3 (KJV)</p>
    <p>Couples who honor God with their bodies honor each other with their hearts.</p>

    <h2>4. Communication Should Be Honest and Grace-Filled</h2>
    <p>Many relationships fail not because of lack of love, but lack of healthy communication. A godly relationship thrives when both people speak truth with grace (Ephesians 4:15) and listen with humility. Good communication means:</p>
    <p>Speaking kindly, even when upset; Being honest, not passive aggressive; Listening carefully, not waiting to argue back; Praying before reacting in anger</p>

    <h2>5. Both People Should Help Each Other Grow</h2>
    <p>A healthy Christian relationship should make you more like Christ, not less. Growth means encouragement, accountability, and helping each other use God-given gifts and purpose.</p>
    <p>“Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.” —Proverbs 27:17 (KJV)</p>
    <p>A relationship rooted in Christ pushes both people toward the calling God placed on their lives.</p>

    <h3>Final Thought</h3>
    <p>God did not design relationships to complete us—He designed them to complement what He is already doing in our lives. When Christ is the foundation, love becomes stronger, purpose becomes clearer, and joy becomes deeper.</p>
    <p>Healthy Christian relationships are not perfect, but they are rooted in a perfect Savior.</p>
    <h4>Let Christ be the center, and everything else will fall into place.</h4>
